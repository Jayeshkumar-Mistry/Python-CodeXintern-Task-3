### **Features of the Tool**:
1. **Matrix Input**:
   - Accepts user-defined dimensions (rows and columns) for matrices.
   - Takes matrix elements row-by-row, ensuring accurate input through validation.
   
2. **Basic Operations**:
   - **Addition**: Computes the element-wise sum of two matrices of the same dimensions.
   - **Subtraction**: Computes the element-wise difference between two matrices.
   
3. **Advanced Operations**:
   - **Multiplication**: Performs matrix multiplication (dot product) if the dimensions are compatible (e.g., columns of Matrix 1 equal rows of Matrix 2).
   - **Transpose**: Displays the transpose of a given matrix, swapping its rows and columns.
   - **Determinant**: Calculates the determinant of a square matrix (if applicable).

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensures users input the correct number of elements for each row.
   - Validates matrix dimensions for operations like multiplication and determinant calculation.
   - Provides clear error messages for invalid inputs or incompatible dimensions.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - Prompts users for input in a step-by-step manner.
   - Displays results in a structured and readable format.
